Rules:
Gentlemen, this is WAR! Your troops lie in front of you, neatly stacked into your pile. Each player draws 6 cards from the pile. You then pick one card to play. If your card is higher then
your opponents, you win your card back in addition to their card. If your card is lower, you lose your card. GAMECHANGER! If the type matches your trainer type, you get a plus one to your
attack. If you manage to get a joker, GOD HELP YOUR ENEMIES. Jokers wipe the field, being Team Rocket they steal the opponents pokemon for you. Happy war gentlemen, and good luck.
