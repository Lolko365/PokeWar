Rules:
Gentlemen, this is WAR! Your troops lie in front of you, neatly stacked into your pile. Each player draws 6 cards from the pile. You then pick one card to play. If your card is higher then
your opponents, you win your card back in addition to their card. If your card is lower, you lose your card. GAMECHANGER! If the type matches your trainer type, you get a plus one to your
attack. If you manage to get a joker, GOD HELP YOUR ENEMIES. Jokers wipe the field, being Team Rocket they steal the opponents pokemon for you. Happy war gentlemen, and good luck.

In this game, suits are "types"
Heart - Fire
Diamond - Grass
Spade - Electric
Club - Water

At the beginning of the game the 4 ace cards are removed from the deck. Players select one for themselves.
Then the deck is split between the two players, cards remain face down. Each player can then draw 6 cards from their decks.
Each round, each player selects one card from their hand to play. Everytime a player places a card on the field from their hand, they draw one from their deck (if possible) Here is where the fun starts:
  - If either player plays a joker, all cards on the field are discarded from play (including any cards from a war)
  - If a player's ace card has the same suit as the card played, that player gets an extra point.
  - Grass cards get an extra point if a water card is played, Water cards get an extra point if a fire card is played and Fire cards get an extra point if a grass card is played.
  - The player with the highest points wins the round and takes all cards on the field. If the players points are equal, then a war is started and each player selects three cards to place (face down) on the field and the round restarts.
The player to collect all active cards in the game wins! (Player with no cards loses)
